Project: Exploratory Data Analysis of IPL dataset using Python

Description:

This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset using Python. The IPL is a professional Twenty20 cricket league established in 2008. It is the most popular and lucrative cricket league in the world.

The EDA will focus on the following areas:

Understanding the overall trends of the IPL, such as the number of matches played, the number of teams participating, the number of runs scored and most run getters over the years.
Analyzing the performance of individual teams and players.
Identifying the factors that contribute to winning and losing matches.

Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is a combination of two datasets:

matches.csv: This dataset contains match-level information, such as the date of the match, the teams involved, the venue, and the result of the match.
deliveries.csv: This dataset contains ball-by-ball information, such as the bowler, the batsman, the type of delivery, and the outcome of the delivery.
Tools and libraries used:

The following tools and libraries were used in this project:
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn

Usage:
To run the EDA, simply open the Jupyter Notebook file EDA on IPL Matches.ipynb and execute the cells one by one.

Conclusion:

This EDA project provides a valuable overview of the IPL dataset and its potential applications. The insights gained from this analysis can be used by IPL teams, players, and fans to improve their performance and understanding of the game.
